### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Data profilling.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA Exploratory data analysis involved exploring the bank loan data to answer key questions, such as:
 - What is the MTD and MoM 
	- Total Loan Application?
	- Total Funded Amount?
	- Total Amount Recieved?
	- Average Interest Rate?
	- Average Debt to income ratio?
	- Good Loan percentage vs Bad Loan?
	- Average Debt to income ratio?
 - What is Total Loan Application trend by Month in past two year
 - What is the Top 10 state for loan
 - Which employment leght has the highest loan application
 - What mostly is the loan purpose taking the loan
 - What term is the loan application
 - Who among the home owner mostly taking the loan

### Data Analysis

In data analysis the values are further verified using SQL Server Management Studio to check the correctness of data prior applying to the reports

### Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
